# UC Davis ENG 006 Final Project \\ President (Card Game 29)
Hey there!
This is the repo that my group used to make our card game for the final project of ENG 006. You are welcome to use our code as inspiration for your own projects, and any code taken directly from here should be creddited accordingly in complaince with UC Davis Code of Acedemic Conduct.

## Source Control
To push an pull code form MATLAB, we used Simulink. There are some werid quirks with the way that Git interacts with `.mlapp` files, namely in protected code tied to app elements. Be careful when merging branches, as you risk overwritting sections of the UI if merged in the wrong order. 

## Setup
All essential code is immedately under the `src` folder. Additional code for testing and experimentation can be found in subsequent folders.
